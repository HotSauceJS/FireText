# FireText - Node.js + Firebase + Twilio

Open-source real-time chat is cool, but wouldn't it be cooler if it could also text my peeps?

Use [Twilio](http://twilio.github.io/twilio-node/) to enable SMS notifications and listeners in Firebase's [Firechat](http://firebase.github.io/firechat/).   

Built in Node.js, Express, and hosted on Heroku.
